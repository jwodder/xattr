TO DO
- Implement:
 - printing of attribute size?
 - switch to only list certain attributes?
- Take care of single hex digits in hex attribute values
- Modify the return value if a non-fatal error occurred during execution?
- Desired command-line syntax:
 - For listing or removing certain attributes:
 $ xattr [switches] pattern [pattern ...] filename
   ...where 'pattern' is a shell wildcard pattern to be matched against the
   attribute names with fnmatch()
 - For listing or removing all attributes:
 $ xattr [switches] -A filename [filename ...]
 - For setting attributes:
 $ xattr [switches] name=value [name=value ...] filename
  ...where '='s within names are escaped with backslashes
